# Face Detection using python
This project is a Python-based application designed to detect human faces in images and videos. It focuses exclusively on identifying human faces, ignoring other objects in the frame.

Modules used in this project:

OpenCV 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful module that provides a wide range of functions and classes for various computer vision tasks. These tasks include image and video processing, object detection, and machine learning. OpenCV is widely used in both academic and commercial settings due to its comprehensive functionality and ease of use.

Files used in the project:

Haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml 

This is a pre-trained classifier file used with OpenCV. The XML file contains data that defines the parameters of a Haar Cascade classifier, which is specifically trained for detecting frontal faces. Haar Cascade classifiers are effective for face detection tasks due to their ability to quickly and accurately identify facial features.
